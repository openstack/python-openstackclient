OpenStackClient (aka OSC) is a command-line client for OpenStack that brings
the command set for Compute, Identity, Image, Network, Object Store and Block
Storage APIs together in a single shell with a uniform command structure.

The primary goal is to provide a unified shell command structure and a common
language to describe operations in OpenStack.

Getting Started
===============

OpenStack Client can be installed from PyPI using pip::

    pip install python-openstackclient

There are a few variants on getting help.  A list of global options and supported
commands is shown with ``--help``::

   openstack --help

There is also a ``help`` command that can be used to get help text for a specific
command::

    openstack help
    openstack help server create

If you want to make changes to the OpenStackClient for testing and contribution,
make any changes and then run::

    python setup.py develop

or::

    pip install -e .

Configuration
=============

The CLI is configured via environment variables and command-line
options as listed in [here](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/authentication.html)
[a link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)

Authentication using username/password is most commonly used::

   export OS_AUTH_URL=<url-to-openstack-identity>
   export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
   export OS_PROJECT_NAME=<project-name>
   export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=<project-domain-name>
   export OS_USERNAME=<username>
   export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=<user-domain-name>
   export OS_PASSWORD=<password>  # (optional)

The corresponding command-line options look very similar::

   --os-auth-url <url>
   --os-identity-api-version 3
   --os-project-name <project-name>
   --os-project-domain-name <project-domain-name>
   --os-username <username>
   --os-user-domain-name <user-domain-name>
   [--os-password <password>]

If a password is not provided above (in plaintext), you will be interactively
prompted to provide one securely.
